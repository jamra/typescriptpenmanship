Drawing with your mouse on canvas with typescript

The purpose of this project is to allow for signatures in an app I am working on. The canvas element will generate an image, which will be uploaded to the server. The image will be used by PDFSharp to append to an existing PDF in a predefined locaiton.

##TODOs
* draw "X" + line to guide signature
* interpolation of signature using cubic bezier (this is hard)
